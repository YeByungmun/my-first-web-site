    <h2>HTML 이란?</h2>
    <p> <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/" target="_blank" title="html5 speicification">HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</a> is a type of markup language.[1] It is used <strong>to make <u>webpages</u>.</strong> Webpages can include writing, links, pictures, and even sound and video. HTML tells web browsers what webpages should look like. HTML also adds meta information to webpages. Meta information is information about about a webpage e.g., the name of the person who created the page. Web browsers usually do not show meta information.</p>

    HTML is often used with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript. CSS is used to change the way HTML looks. JavaScript tells websites how to behave. It can also change HTML and CSS.</p>
